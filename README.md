# Fake News Detection with DistilBERT – MLOps Pipeline

A reproducible end-to-end Machine Learning workflow for **Fake News Detection**, built with:
- **DistilBERT** for language understanding
- **DVC** for data versioning and reproducible pipelines
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registry
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation

---

## Project Overview

This project detects whether a given news article is **fake or real** using NLP-based models.
The pipeline includes:
1. **EDA** - Explore the data to understand patterns
2. **Preprocessing** - Clean, normalize, and prepare data
3. **Model Training** - Baseline (TF-IDF) → Fine-tuned DistilBERT
4. **Explainability** - SHAP/LIME-based interpretation
5. **MLOps Integration** - DVC + MLflow + GitHub Actions
